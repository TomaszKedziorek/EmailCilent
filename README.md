Email client application for Gmail.

After downloading and building the project with Maven, it allows you to log in to your gmail mail (recently you should create a separate password for your Gmail account for less secure applications).

The application allows you to write and send new messages as well as reply to a message. Reading messages, downloading and later previewing attachments. A read message can be marked back as unread. We can also permanently delete messages. The application can handle more than one user account.
